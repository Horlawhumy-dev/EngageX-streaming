# Cleanest working version 6-8 secs sentiment analysis
# Fixed the order of the first three chunks
# S3 video concatenation
# Added AI Audience Question functionality triggered at intervals and controlled by a toggle
# Updated S3 bucket structure to include user ID
# Fixed SynchronousOnlyOperation error in connect by accessing user within sync_to_async
# Fixed S3 key extraction for compilation with new URL format
# Handled CancelledError in background task
